[Version]
Signature="$CHICAGO$"  ; Represents all Windows OS's

; Select an appropriate class for the device.
; There are several options:
; - Use the Jungo class.
; - Define your own class by generating a private GUID and a class description.
; - Use a system-defined class. This is required for a device that belongs to 
;   a device class that is supported by system-provided drivers, i.e. HID or USB Audio.
;   For example, to replace a default USB mouse driver you have to specify the 
;   description and GUID of HID class:
;       Class=HIDClass
;       ClassGuid={745a17a0-74d3-11d0-b6fe-00a0c90f57da}
;
; We use a Jungo class, you may modify here and use a different class:
Class=Jungo
ClassGuid={c671678c-82c1-43f3-d700-0049433e9a4b}
